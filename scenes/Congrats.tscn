This specific game feels like we can possibly expand on it, so maybe you might wanna check out our itch.io pages for updates...maybe. Regardless, we're really glad for all the playtesting and the opportunity to test our skills out!

P.S. To restart the game, just press 'J'. 

Also, for you 100% completionists out there, there's a possible 31 collectible coins in this demo level, as well as 2 mushrooms to find (including the one in the store, of course). If you want to go crazy with the Blackjack, try to get as many coins as possible..."
